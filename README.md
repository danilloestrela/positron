# Testing wordpress theme Positron
This project was a test that I made for a company (12h in call with the evaluator), such a nice challenge. It still doesn't have the mobile and tablet version, I will implement it in the future.  

## What do I use

This project was made with little PHP, jquery, lots of CSS flex box and SASS. Yes, there are lots of errors in it, maybe can be a challenge for people who wants to fix it? Yeah...
